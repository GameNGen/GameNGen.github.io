## Abstract

We present _GameNGen_, the first game engine powered entirely by a neural model
that enables real-time interaction with a complex environment over long trajectories at high quality.
_GameNGen_ can interactively simulate the classic game DOOM at over 20 frames per second on a single
TPU. _GameNGen_ simulations do not suffer from accumulated deterioration even after long play sessions,
achieving a PSNR of 29.4, comparable to lossy JPEG compression.
Human raters are only slightly better than random chance at distinguishing short clips of the game
from clips of the simulation.
_GameNGen_ is trained in two phases:
(1) an RL-agent learns to play the game and the training sessions are recorded, and
(2) a diffusion model is trained to produce the next frame, conditioned on the sequence of past frames and
actions. Conditioning augmentations enable stable auto-regressive generation over long trajectories.
